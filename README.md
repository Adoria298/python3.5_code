# python3.5_code
My python projects that I don't feel are big enough to deserve their own repositories, yet do want to share with the world. Python is the main scripting language, but markup and data storage formats are used when required.

## Using this code
All code in this repository is designed for use with `python3` or `python3.5` on Linux, `py -3`, `py -3.5`, or `python` on Windows and `python` or `pythonw` on Mac. If you attempt to use this code in a python other than CPython 3.5 (or 3.6) it may not work. Most code in this repository requires these dependencies:

#### Colorama (for most CLI projects)
    pip install colorama
    pip3 install colorama 

#### Tkinter (for most GUI projects)
If not installed by default, use pip:

    pip install python-tk
    pip3 install python-tk
